# OpenClassroom-LTI-Example


This php example gets the user role name and email on the first "Generate" screen and submits the form to itself.

After the submission, it generates a valid signature for LTI request for defined parameters and shows the webform to open the assignment.

Depending on your use-case, you can generate the signature on the server and auto-submit HTML with javascript on the client side.
